    	<div class='col-md-8'>
    		<p class='interestsmine'>Photography is my hobby. Having been the director of the Photography and Films club at IIT Delhi for a year, I can say that I am 
          quite enthusiastic about it as well. Do check out my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/varun.desai10">instagram</a> page. I also enjoy photo manipulation, 
          so I also post random edits on that page too. The best thing about it is 
          that your imagination is you limit, quite literally. Photography also seeded my love to Travel, and make travel videos. 
          I made one when I went to a trip to Nainital with my friends. You can see that too on my channel. 
          Photography also worked as an <mark>excuse</mark>to explore various parts of Delhi too, and my college has many enthusiastic 
          seniors and people which helped me build upon my love for photography and improve my skills!</p>

    		<h3>Music</h3>
    	</div>
    	<div class = 'col-md-8'>
    		<p class='interestsmine'>I also love Music, and alsmost always have it playing in the background, no matter what I am doing. 
        I also play the <mark>Keyboard</mark>, since the 8th grade, and have gotten pretty good at it. It is always helpful to have something to relax to when you've had a long day, and It is better when the music comes after yout fingertips. Quite sadly, though, I am not able to play the keyboard regularly when I am at college, because I am busy devoting my time to other things.</p>

    		<h3>Gaming</h3>
    	</div>
    	<div class = 'col-md-8'>
    		<p class='interestsmine'>I also enjoy playing video games from time to time. I was a little short of a CSGO addict a few months back, and thought it was wasting a lot of my time and stopping me from doing something productive, and have played it only a few times since then. <mark>FIFA</mark> is my favourite game currently, because nothing beats the celebration you get to do in front of your <i style="font-style: italic;">dear Friend's</i> face. As a kid I had a PS3 and played a lot of games on it, but sadly, it doesn't work anymore. I don't want to sell it, it holds too many memories. *cries in corner*</p>
